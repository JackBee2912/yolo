Build a real-time fish/shrimp larvae counting system
using a pre-trained YOLOv8 single-class detection model
and ByteTrack for multi-object tracking.

The YOLOv8 model has already been trained and fine-tuned
on fish/shrimp larvae data captured from a fixed camera
and controlled mechanical flow.

Do NOT perform per-frame detection-based counting.

Use object tracking with ByteTrack combined with
dual-gate (or line-crossing) logic, direction validation,
and per-track-ID cooldown to perform counting.

Increment the count only when a tracked object ID
crosses the virtual gate from region A to region B.

Ignore:
- Per-frame detection counts
- Backward crossings (B → A)
- Oscillations near the gate within the cooldown window

Segmentation or density-based counting MUST NOT be used
in the default pipeline and should only be considered
as a fallback if prolonged clustering or severe occlusion
is detected.

The system must be optimized for:
- High accuracy
- Temporal stability
- Real-time performance
on a fixed camera with a controlled, single-layer flow.
